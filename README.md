# Introduction
This app implements yet another ERP functionality to extend the standard CRM. The app is specifically tailored for my personal needs as a consulting and implementation partner.
It is intended to be used as a template to create your own unlocked package from it. I will continue to add new functionality as I see needed.

# Overview of functionality
In a galaxy far, far away, this app will provide actual Enterprise Resource Planning functionality. For now, you can:
* Create "Projects" to Accounts to track high-level ... well ... business projects. NO project management capability!
* Add time entries to said Projects to track and estimate efforts
* Bill time entries and generate invoices for your accounts

For now, I use JIRA to organize work and plan roadmap. So no transparency (yet).

# Get Involved
Please contact me if you want to fork the repo or contribute. Lincense is tbd.
